Course CSc 220 Algorithms Fall Semester 2016
Homework Project 2
Given 10/24/2016, Due 11/07/2016
Take the height-balanced tree code, and add a function
int find next larger(tree node t *tree, int q);
the smallest key larger than q that occurs in a leaf.
If there is no key larger than q in a leaf, it returns q. The programming language
is C or C++; test your code before submission using the gcc or g++ compiler. Please
remove all dead code; try to program as clearly as possible, since I try to read it. Do not
copy code from another student or from the web; this is an easy project, and must be all
your own work.
